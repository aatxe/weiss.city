Hi, I'm Ariel (she/her) from the [Luau](https://luau-lang.org) team. I work as a Software Engineer and Tech Lead
at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com) where my efforts are primarily focused on the design of and
developer experience with [Luau](https://luau-lang.org)'s type system & ecosystem. Its gradual
type system is really quite fun, featuring powerful features like
[semantic subtyping](https://blog.roblox.com/2022/11/semantic-subtyping-luau/),
[typestate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis), and [partial type operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_family).

Outside of work, I'm a [FromSoft](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) fanatic, chronic Savage raider in the critically-acclaimed
MMORPG [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/), and a lover of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/),
[Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer) & other [ttrpgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game). In music, I'm a jazz and hyperpop appreciator, especially [Samara Joy](https://www.samarajoy.com/) & [Chet Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker), [brakence](https://www.brakence.com/) & [underscores](https://underscores.bandcamp.com/). In other media, I adore classic cinema, some of my favorite films include [Mulholland Dr. (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/), [Nora Inu (1949)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041699/), [Taxi Driver (1976)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/), [Ã€ bout de souffle (1960)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/), and [Stalker (1979)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/). In television, I love to watch crime dramas, especially [The Sopranos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/), and sci-fi anime like [Ghost in the Shell](https://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Koukaku_Kidoutai__Stand_Alone_Complex), [Witch from Mercury](https://myanimelist.net/anime/49828/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Suisei_no_Majo) & [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).

In my past life, I was an [academic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01083-2). I was
a [PhD student](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AKe9iAQAAAAJ) & [NSF Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org) at [Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) working on a
formal semantics for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) with [Amal Ahmed](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/). As an
undergraduate, I worked with [Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/) on static verification and
program repair for [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.
