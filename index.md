I'm Aaron (they/them), and I'm a Software Engineer & Language Designer at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com)
working on [Luau](https://luau-lang.org), a gradually-typed scripting language derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org).
My efforts are primarily focused on the design of and developer experience with [Luau](https://luau-lang.org)'s type system.

Outside of work, I'm a [FromSoft](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) fanatic, chronic Savage raider in the critically-acclaimed
MMORPG [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/), and a lover of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)
& other tabletop roleplaying games. In other media, I'm a hyperpop appreciator, especially [brakence](https://www.brakence.com/) and [underscores](https://underscores.bandcamp.com/), and mecha anime enjoyer, especially [Witch from Mercury](https://myanimelist.net/anime/49828/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Suisei_no_Majo) and [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).

In my past life, I was an academic. I was a PhD student & [NSF Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org) at
[Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) working on a formal semantics for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) with
[Amal Ahmed](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/). And as an undergraduate, I worked with
[Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/) on static verification and program repair for [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.
