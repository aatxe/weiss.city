[![A photo of Aaron!][aaron-img]][aaron-img-full]

I'm Aaron (they/them), and I'm a Software Engineer & Language Designer at [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com)
working on [Luau](https://luau-lang.org), a gradually-typed scripting language derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org).
My efforts are primarily focused on the design of and developer experience with [Luau](https://luau-lang.org)'s type system.

Outside of work, I'm a [FromSoft](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) fanatic, chronic Savage raider in the critically-acclaimed
MMORPG [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/), and a lover of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)
& other tabletop roleplaying games. In other media, I'm a hyperpop appreciator, especially [brakence](https://www.brakence.com/) & [underscores](https://underscores.bandcamp.com/), and mecha anime enjoyer, especially [Witch from Mercury](https://myanimelist.net/anime/49828/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Suisei_no_Majo) & [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).

In my past life, I was an [academic](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2021/the-mental-health-crisis-in-science/). I was
a [PhD student](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AKe9iAQAAAAJ) & [NSF Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org) at [Northeastern](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) working on a
formal semantics for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) with [Amal Ahmed](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/). As an
undergraduate, I worked with [Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/) on static verification and
program repair for [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) manifests.
