# weiss.city

This is the latest iteration of my personal website. It's powered proudly by [11ty][11ty], and
hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. You can find the production website [here][awe].

## Building the Site

With [`npm`][npm] installed, you can build the site from the shell:
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or you can run a local server that rebuilds on file system update like so:
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

## Licensing

The code that powers this website (e.g. `css/`, `_includes/`, and `.eleventy.js`) is in the public domain
(via the [CC0][cc0] dedication), but the content (e.g. `posts/`, `pubs/`, and `images/`) remain
under their respective licenses (defaulting to all rights reserved).
